# Technical:

I mainly used Swift and XCode to develop Thrifty. For user data, I integrated user login with email, Google, and Apple and stored the data in the cloud using Firebase Thorough testing of my app was done through TestFlight, where I gathered user feedback over 2 weeks to ensure a bug-free app upon launch.
