excerpt: "Itep into the shoes of a wizard in A Little RPG, a game that combines strategy and magic in a charming, minimalist world. As the wizard, you’ll navigate the terrain by clicking to direct your path in a point-and-click movement system. Your journey won’t be without challenges, as roaming golems populate the land, wandering aimlessly until you come too close. Once alerted, they’ll turn hostile, forcing you to rely on your magical prowess. Fire off magic bolts to fend them off and claim victory."
