# Overview

Geometry Dash - Scratch Edition is my parody of the popular rhythm-based platformer, created on scratch.mit.edu, and was one of the first games I ever created. I hand-drew all the sprites and all code was done by me. The music was imported from Geometry Dash.

This game has over 600,000 views on Scratch, and features an infinite survival level for endless fun. Customize your character and music to your liking, and see how long you can survive.
